# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 2 workbook

You will use GitHub to keep track of your progress through the course and also as a process journal to document the making of your projects.

You can fill out the workbook from the GitHub website using markdown language for the documents and they will be turned into web pages for you. See the markdown reference guide here: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

The template for this assessment is in the file `index.md`, which you should edit in the main directory of this repository. There are no subfolders like in the first assessment.
