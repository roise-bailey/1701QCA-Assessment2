This source is focused on the evolution of the manipulation of marionette puppets. This was useful to the development of my project by helping me form an understanding of the function of a marionette and how I can replicate this technology in my project.


## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
A motor driven mobile that moves under certain conditions

### Design concept 1 ###

Micro:bit baby mobile where the base spins and individual strings move up and down as the motor spins.

Pros
- Able to include various micro:bit functions such as the use of a motor, light sensor, LED lights and possible various other elements.

Cons
- Similar to products that already exist, will end up making an inferior inversion.
- Need to purchase additional parts such as a motor.

### Design concept 2 ###
A mobile shaped device that you can install under a lamp shade were a motion sensor will detect a persons hand going in to turn on the light, lowering spiders using a motor.

Pros
- The concept will achievable to finish by the end of the course.

Cons
- Difficult it neatly build the mobile under a lamp shade.
- Simple technology- not challenging enough.

### Final design concept ###
A mobile of a single spider where when the motion sensor senses movement, the motor turns, pulling individial strings that move the spiders legs while playing a song.

Pros
- Construction of the project is achievable with elements that are still challenging.
- Sticks to the design intent of a motor controlled mobile, while adding in the idea of using it as a halloween decoration.

Cons
- Need to purchase additional parts (Servo Motor and PIR Motion Sensor).


*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

Initial test of the motor included in the Kitronik Inventor's Kit to see if the motor was strong enough to support and move a string. This attempt was unsuccessful- leading to the purchase of the servo motor.

Testing the PIR Motion Sensor

The tests of the PIR Motion Sensor were unsuccessful, most likely due to a lack of power. This is something that will have to be improved before the final project.

## Design process discussion ##
![Image](diamond.png)

Over the working time for this assignment, my concept has changed numerous times with feedback on ideas, and issues with accessing parts. This evolvement of ideas is reflected in the Double Diamond design process with steps being, discover, define, develop and deliver. The evolution has been though my own development and discovery process with major changes happening after a discussion with course instructor, David. Given the current situation with Covid-19 and online learning, I do believe that this process of feedback and development of the project has been hindered. The process of feedback and evolution of ideas would be much faster if we were on campus with immediate feedback unlike the delay between posting and responding online. With Covid-19, many other challenges have been faced that delayed the development of the project such as access to different parts- which took longer to get then expected, meaning I had less time to get familiar with their technology than I would like. This problem will be resolved before the final project is due as I now have more time with the new parts to test different ideas on how to get them to function efficiently. In the development stage of the Double Diamond process, and brainstorming multiple concepts, inspiration was found in talking to friends and family and hearing their opinions on my ideas to form the final concept. The last section of the double diamond process, deliver, involved testing the different technology and learning the best ways to use them in the final project. Testing the servo motor was ultimately successful with the motor working efficiently with extra weight added. Testing the PIR motion sensor was less successful with the sensor being unreliable- this issue is most likely due to a lack of power and is something that needs to be worked on before the final project is due. The project and prototyping of the project up to this point has involves testing individual parts separately, drawing diagrams of the fabrication and the possible materials the final project will use. The next challenge I will face is to get all the elements working together by testing different solutions on a small scale, rejecting those that don’t work and improving on the ones that will. I will also need to build an aesthetically pleasing base for the project and creating the best connections with the wires. I hope to add more elements to the design, such as lights to further enhance the final product, using the Double Diamond process to revise and expand on concepts to finally deliver on the final design.
