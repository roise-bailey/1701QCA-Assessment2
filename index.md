# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 2 workbook

You will use this workbook to keep track of your progress through the course and also as a process journal to document the making of your projects. The comments in italics throughout the template give suggestions about what to include. Feel free to delete those instructions when you have completed the sections.

When you have completed the template, submit the link to the GitHub Pages site for this repository as a link in Learning@Griffith. The link should be something like [https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/](https://qcainteractivemedia.github.io/1701QCA-Assessment2/) where `qcainteractivemedia` is replaced with your GitHub username and `1701QCA-Assessment2` is replaced with whatever you called the repository this template is contained in when you set it up.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
A motor driven mobile that moves under certain conditions

### Design concept 1 ###

Micro:bit baby mobile where the base spins and individual strings move up and down as the moter spins.

Pros
- 

Cons
- 

### Design concept 2 ###
A mobile shaped device that you can install under a lamp shade were a motion sensor will detect a persons hand going in to turn on the light, lowering spiders using a motor.

Pros
- 

Cons
- 

### Final design concept ###
A mobile of a single spider where when the motion sensor senses movement, the motor turns, pulling individial strings that move the spiders legs while playing a song.

Pros
- Construction of the project is achievable with elements that are still challenging.

Cons
- Need to purchase additional parts (Servo Motor and PIR Motion Sensor).


*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

Initial test of the motor included in the Kitronik Inventor's Kit to see if the motor was strong enough to support and move a string. This attempt was unsuccessful- leading to the purchase of the servo motor.

Testing the PIR Motion Sensor

The tests of the PIR Motion Sensor were unsuccessful, most likely due to a lack of power. This is something that will have to be improved before the final project.

Testing the servo motor with additional weight

Testing the motor and button to move one string

Testing the motor with multiple string connected to one object


## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
